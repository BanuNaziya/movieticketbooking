## Overview
The Movie Ticket Booking System is an online application developed using Java and SQL, designed to streamline the process of booking movie tickets. I utilized Visual Studio Code for coding and MySQL Workbench to manage the database. The system features tables for users, admins, movies, showtimes, and theaters, allowing seamless interaction and data management. Users can browse available movies, select showtimes, and book tickets, while admins have the capability to manage movie listings and oversee bookings. This project demonstrates a full-stack approach, integrating a robust backend with a user-friendly interface for an efficient ticket booking experience.
